*My path to graphics*
Over the past few months, I've really found myself drawn to graphics / low-level engineering. Coming from a math background, a lot of software engineering seemed pretty prosaic (sorry). Connecting APIs and databases felt like something I wanted to avoid. But a few months ago, I was watching Jane Street's [Building Machine Learning Systems for a Trillion Trillion Floating Point Operations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=139UPjoq7Kw), and something really clicked. Thinking about GPU threads, warps, memory caches felt like thinking about group actions and homomorphisms. 

I've been learning OpenGL through the oft-recommended learnopengl.com. It really deserves its praise; it is quite comprehensive and pedagogically sound. I find it does just enough hand-holding, with thoughtful progressive overload and active recall. For example, in the *Hello Triangle* chapter, you learn to configure an Element Buffer Object (EBO) to combine triangles into a rectangle, then in the *Shaders* chapter you drop the EBO to focus on building shaders, but the *Textures* chapter uses a rectangle again, which requires you to go back and reconfigure your EBO -- but the book doesn't tell you this. It also gives you code snippets, but often doesn't tell you where they go, which forces you to think about how the rendering pipeline actually process data. You're treated like an active participant in the process, which avoids the very common reason tutorials can be useless.
